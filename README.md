# Fibonacci# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## Description
This Java program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

## Features
- User input for the number of terms
- Displays the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms
- Simple console-based interface

## Code Overview
The program contains a single class `Fibonacci` with a `main` method that:
1. Prompts the user to enter the number of terms
2. Initializes the first two numbers of the sequence (0 and 1)
3. Uses a for loop to calculate and display the sequence

## How to Use
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac Fibonacci.java
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Fibonacci
   ```

3. When prompted, enter the number of terms you want to generate.

## Expected Output
For example, if you enter 10 as the number of terms, the output will be:
```
Enter Term limit of series
10
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

## Note About the Code
There is a potential issue in the code with the line `i=i++`. This line doesn't actually change the value of `i` as expected because the post-increment operator (`i++`) returns the value of `i` before incrementing it. Since the for loop already increments `i` in its update statement, this line is unnecessary and could lead to unexpected behavior.

## Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- The program uses the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which should be imported at the top of the file:
  ```java
  import java.util.Scanner;
  ```
